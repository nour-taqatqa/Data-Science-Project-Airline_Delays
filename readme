**Motivation:**

Air travel has become the new “casual” way of transportation, globally and more so in the US, because of its massive geographic landscape. With that comes the question of whether flight operations have gotten more advanced or not with time. One of the biggest holdbacks to flight operations are delays, which can happen for many different reasons such as weather. With large global effects such as COVID-19 and climate change increasing flight delays, improving flight operations is more important now than ever. A question that then comes to mind is whether flight operations can be improved by studying these delays and observing commonalities in their causes. By analyzing flight data and weather data for flight delays, we can observe which variables have the most importance in delays. This will allow us to not only help improve the air commute and the airline industry, but also to draw conclusions on what weather patterns, flight demographics, and airlines might lead to more successful flights.
